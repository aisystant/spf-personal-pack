## PRINC.001: Synergy of Concurrent Practice Mastery {#princ001-synergy-of-concurrent-practice-mastery}

### Statement

Parallel mastery of self-development practices requires an order of magnitude less time than sequential mastery.

### Explanation

All self-development practices are interconnected and reinforce each other. One minute of systematic slow reading with note-taking simultaneously counts toward thinking in writing. Strategizing uses time accounting data. Leisure organization supports all other practices by preventing burnout. The shared exocortex connects all practices into a single system. Sequential mastery misses these synergies and multiplies total investment time.

## PRINC.002: Learning During Work, Not Before or After {#princ002-learning-during-work}

### Statement

Learning must be integrated into working activity, not separated into a distinct period before or after work.

### Explanation

Knowledge studied during work is immediately applied in current projects, creating a rapid theory-practice-theory feedback loop. This accelerates mastery development and eliminates the artificial boundary between "learning time" and "productive time." Everything studied goes directly to benefit work projects. The separation of learning from work is an industrial-era artifact incompatible with knowledge work.

## PRINC.003: Time as Primary Resource {#princ003-time-as-primary-resource}

### Statement

For a creator, time is the primary resource — analogous to money for an enterprise.

### Explanation

Enterprises invest their main resource (money) to develop. A creator-practitioner is a "small enterprise" that invests time for development steps. Time accounting for a person is equivalent to financial accounting for an enterprise: whoever does not track their resources is more likely to lose them. The analogy extends further: invested time (in new mastery) produces returns; spent time (routine operations) maintains current output; lost time generates nothing.

## PRINC.004: Time Before Money {#princ004-time-before-money}

### Statement

Master the discipline of investing time before attempting to invest money.

### Explanation

The skill of conscious resource allocation and tracking is general. If you have not mastered it at the level of time (a more accessible resource available to everyone), you will not succeed at the level of money. Time investment teaches deliberate allocation, tracking, and returns analysis — the same competencies required for financial investment.

## PRINC.005: Daily Regularity Over Volume {#princ005-daily-regularity-over-volume}

### Statement

25 minutes of daily practice is more effective than 3 hours once a week.

### Explanation

Neural pathways are strengthened by frequency of activation, not duration of a single session. Daily regularity creates a rhythm that reduces cognitive switching costs and makes practice automatic. Irregular high-volume sessions produce fatigue without proportional mastery gains. The minimum viable practice is one pomodoro (25 minutes) per day — this is low enough to maintain even under adverse conditions.

## PRINC.006: Tandem Requirement — Reading Plus Writing {#princ006-tandem-requirement}

### Statement

Systematic slow reading without note-taking is incomplete — reading and thinking in writing form a mandatory tandem.

### Explanation

Reading without notes leads to rapid information loss (forgetting curve). The note-taking during reading creates cognitive resonance — the collision of new information with existing mental models. This resonance IS the learning moment. Without it, reading degrades to passive consumption. The reverse also holds: thinking in writing without a reading pipeline lacks material input.

## PRINC.007: Skin in the Game — Publish for Peers {#princ007-skin-in-the-game}

### Statement

Publishing drafts among peers is mandatory, not optional — without "skin in the game," thinking lacks quality pressure.

### Explanation

As Nassim Taleb stated: "I am a completely different person if I have no risk." Without publishing, thinking in writing remains an internal exercise without reality-testing. Publishing drafts (even imperfect ones) among peers creates accountability and tests hypotheses against other perspectives. The minimum requirement is weekly sharing. The draft does not need to be publication-quality — it needs to be better than yesterday's draft.

## PRINC.008: In Difficult Situations — Write {#princ008-in-difficult-situations-write}

### Statement

Evolution offers "fight or flight" — techno-evolution offers: "In difficult situations — write."

### Explanation

When facing complex problems, the default biological response (stress, avoidance, impulsive action) wastes time and energy. Externalizing the problem through writing decomposes it, switches attention from suffering to problem-solving, and creates an artifact for future reference. A few pomodoros spent describing the current situation often reveals solutions invisible during emotional processing. Writing activates slow thinking where fast thinking produces only reaction.

## PRINC.009: Slow Thinking for Speaking {#princ009-slow-thinking-for-speaking}

### Statement

Thinking by speaking requires deliberate engagement of slow thinking (System 2), not the fast thinking used in everyday conversation.

### Explanation

Ordinary conversation operates on System 1 (fast, automatic). But articulating concepts for the first time requires System 2 (slow, deliberate). The practitioner must consciously slow down, attend to the exact meanings of concepts being articulated, and verify that concept usage matches the source material. Speaking in a familiar "cocktail party" mode produces the illusion of understanding without actual knowledge integration.

## PRINC.010: If Everything Is Clear — Articulate It {#princ010-if-clear-articulate}

### Statement

The feeling of "I understand" is unreliable until tested by articulation — if you cannot say it aloud, you do not truly understand.

### Explanation

During study, the sense of comprehension is often premature. Material "seems clear" because recognition (fast thinking) is confused with understanding (slow thinking). The falsification test: turn on a recorder and try to explain the concept. If you stumble, rephrase, or cannot connect it to other concepts — the understanding was illusory. This principle prevents the common failure of progressing through material without actual learning.

## PRINC.011: Echeloned Leisure {#princ011-echeloned-leisure}

### Statement

Leisure practices must be distributed across ALL time horizons (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years) — no horizon should be empty.

### Explanation

Humans lack a "charge indicator" showing depletion level, so proactive scheduling is required. Echeloned leisure creates a systemic defense against fatigue, burnout, and depression — analogous to echeloned defense in military strategy. A 5-minute break between pomodoros (hour horizon) is as important as a yearly vacation (year horizon). An empty time horizon is a vulnerability: without daily micro-rest, weekly breaks are insufficient; without monthly leisure events, daily rest alone cannot prevent burnout.

## PRINC.012: Rhythm in Leisure {#princ012-rhythm-in-leisure}

### Statement

Leisure practices should become rhythmic — predictable, scheduled, and eventually automatic.

### Explanation

Rhythmic activities require less decision energy than ad-hoc ones. A weekly hiking day, a monthly theater visit, or a daily evening walk — once established as rhythm — execute without willpower expenditure. Initial tracking of leisure practices is explicit (in the exocortex); over time, rhythm makes tracking unnecessary. Unpredictable leisure creates planning overhead and often gets displaced by urgent work.

## PRINC.013: Environment Is Not a Given — It Is a Result of Creativity {#princ013-environment-is-creativity}

### Statement

If you cannot create a favorable environment, you lack knowledge and/or time — not possibility.

### Explanation

Applying David Deutsch's principle of optimism: any physical transformation that is not forbidden by the laws of nature is achievable given sufficient knowledge. Capital and education serve to develop environment. Education is a potential ticket to a better environment. The key shift: from "I'm stuck with this environment" to "I haven't yet learned how to change it." This reframing activates the creator's agency toward long-term environment formation.

## PRINC.014: Strategy Is Nothing, Strategizing Is Everything {#princ014-strategy-is-nothing}

### Statement

A strategy document becomes obsolete the day after it is written — what matters is the continuous process of adaptation.

### Explanation

Any written strategy is a snapshot of hypotheses at a single point in time. New information, changed circumstances, and tested hypotheses immediately make the document incomplete. The value lies not in the document but in the disciplined process of weekly review, hypothesis testing, and adaptation. Treating strategy as a completed plan (rather than a living process) leads to rigid adherence to outdated assumptions.

## PRINC.015: Either You Strategize or Others Plan You {#princ015-strategize-or-be-planned}

### Statement

Without an externalized strategy visible in the exocortex, someone else is using your attention, time, and resources for their projects.

### Explanation

Strategy functions as an immune system — a fast filter against foreign activity that provides no personal benefit. Without explicit priorities and criteria, the creator defaults to reacting to others' urgencies. The test: when a new request arrives, can you immediately check it against your strategy? If no strategy exists in the exocortex, there is no filter, and external demands fill available capacity by default.

## PRINC.016: Kill Multitasking {#princ016-kill-multitasking}

### Statement

Proactively limit concurrent projects to a maximum of 7 priority projects, starting with 1-3.

### Explanation

"Kill multitasking" means that you preemptively limit the number of simultaneously executed projects. Sequential execution often yields first results faster than parallel execution of many projects. The daily routine reveals available capacity: if the schedule shows no free time, starting another project is self-deception. Excess projects create context-switching overhead and reduce throughput on every project.

## PRINC.017: Planning Is More Important Than the Plan {#princ017-planning-over-plan}

### Statement

A plan must always exist, but establishing a regular planning process is more important than any single plan.

### Explanation

Plans are continuously updated as circumstances change. The plan from Monday may be irrelevant by Wednesday. But the discipline of regular planning — reviewing tasks, assigning work formulations, updating time budgets — produces adaptability. Without the process, even excellent plans are not maintained. The plan is the artifact; planning is the method that keeps it alive.

## PRINC.018: No Hidden Work {#princ018-no-hidden-work}

### Statement

Do not perform work that is not recorded in the plan — no hidden work.

### Explanation

Unrecorded work distorts time budgets, creates invisible load, and prevents realistic planning. If something takes less than 2 minutes (David Allen's GTD rule), do it immediately without recording. Everything else must be in the task list before execution. Hidden work is the most common reason why plans "don't work" — capacity is consumed by untracked activities.

## PRINC.019: Important Work on Protected Time {#princ019-important-on-protected-time}

### Statement

Important (developmental) work must be scheduled daily on maximally protected time slots — typically morning hours.

### Explanation

Important work advances long-term goals and involves developing new mastery (invested time). Current/routine work maintains operations. Urgent tasks arise during the day and compete for attention. Placing important work in the morning — when interruptions are minimal — protects it from displacement. Investment projects in the first half of the day, routine in the second. A large amount of urgent work is usually a direct result of insufficient attention to important work.

## PRINC.020: Entry Ritual — Role, Method, Work Product {#princ020-entry-ritual}

### Statement

When starting a work session (turning on the pomodoro tracker), consciously name: the role you are acting in, the method you are applying, and the work product you expect to produce.

### Explanation

The entry ritual transforms the pomodoro tracker from a simple timer into a tool for conscious attention direction. In the few seconds of starting the timer, the creator answers three questions: Who am I right now? (role), How am I acting? (method), What will I produce? (work product). This practice extends the classic Pomodoro technique with conceptual grounding from systems thinking. Without the ritual, time is accounted but not invested — the creator works without awareness of role or method.

## Scope

**Bounded context**: [01A-bounded-context.md](01-domain-contract/01A-bounded-context.md)

### What This Pack Covers

This pack captures knowledge about **characteristics and states of creator** as an engineering description:

- Characteristics of creator (agency, personality caliber, etc.)
- States (temporary modes of functioning)
- Roles (positions in activity: agent, mentor, analyst, architect)
- Indicators (observable signs of characteristics/states)
- Assessment/testing methods
- Work products of assessment
- Failure modes in interpretation
- Distinctions that structure the domain

### What This Pack Does NOT Cover

| Out of Scope | Where It Belongs |
|--------------|------------------|
| Learning curricula, courses | Downstream learning materials |
| Development trajectories | Downstream programs |
| Transition scenarios | Downstream guides |
| Therapy/clinical practice | Different domain (mental health) |
| Motivation/inspiration content | Downstream engagement |
| AI embeddings as source of truth | AI implementations |

### FPF Distinctions Used

| FPF Distinction | How Used in This Pack |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| method vs tool | [D.001](01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d001-method-vs-tool) — fundamental to all methods |
| work product | [D.005](01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d005-work-product-vs-description) — defines observable outputs |
| role vs person | [D.002](01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d002-role-vs-person) — structures responsibilities |
| system vs process | Avoid "personal development as a system" conflation |

# [PD.WP.008] Self-Development Mastery Progress

---

## Definition

**Self-Development Mastery Progress** is a checklist tracking progress across all 8 self-development practices, with indicators for each of 4 mastery degrees (Explanation, Skill, Habit, Mastery). Includes concept understanding tables and quantitative parameters per practice. It is the primary instrument for assessing where the agent stands in the learner method and what transitions are next.

A mastery progress checklist is NOT:
- A grade sheet (it tracks degrees of mastery, not scores)
- A completion certificate (mastery is a continuum, not a binary state)
- A self-assessment questionnaire (it requires observable indicators, not subjective feeling)
- A learning plan (it records current state, not intended trajectory)

---

## Purpose

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **State visibility** | Makes current mastery degree across all 8 practices explicit |
| **Gap detection** | Reveals which practices lag behind and need attention |
| **Progress tracking** | Enables comparison across time periods (monthly snapshots) |
| **Transition planning** | Identifies which mastery degree transition is next for each practice |

## Produced By

| Method | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| [PD.METHOD.002 Learner Method](../03-methods/PD.METHOD.002-learner-method.md) | Primary method — assessment of mastery degrees across practices |

---

## Consumed By

| Consumer | How Used |
|----------|----------|
| [PD.METHOD.008 Strategizing](../03-methods/PD.METHOD.008-strategizing.md) | Informs selection of learning-related priority projects |
| [Learner](../02-domain-entities/02A-roles.md#learner) | Self-monitoring of development trajectory |

---

## Existence Criteria

| Criterion | Test |
|-----------|------|
| **Written artifact** | Checklist exists in exocortex, can be opened and inspected |
| **All 8 practices covered** | Each of the 8 self-development practices has an entry |
| **Mastery degree per practice** | Each practice has a current mastery degree assessment (one of 4 degrees) |
| **Concept understanding** | Contains concept understanding tables per practice |
| **Quantitative parameters** | Includes quantitative indicators where applicable |
| **Updated monthly** | Last update date is within the past month |

**Existence check**: Can another person inspect this artifact and determine the agent's current mastery level across all 8 self-development practices?

---

## Quality Criteria

| Criterion | Description | How to Verify |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Completeness** | All 8 practices assessed | Count entries |
| **Evidence-based** | Mastery degrees backed by observable indicators, not self-perception | Indicators documented |
| **Temporal consistency** | Same assessment framework used across periods | Compare snapshots |
| **Honest assessment** | No inflation of mastery degrees | Cross-check with actual artifacts |
| **Actionable gaps** | Weak areas have identified next steps | Transitions noted |

---

## Typical Form

| Form | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Matrix table** | Rows: 8 practices. Columns: 4 mastery degrees. Cells: achieved/not achieved with indicators |
| **Checklist per practice** | Separate section for each practice with concept table + quantitative parameters |
| **Exocortex dashboard** | Structured note with links to evidence artifacts |

### Minimal Structure

```
| # | Practice | Current Degree | Key Indicator | Next Transition |
|---|----------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Time Accounting | Skill | Weekly budget maintained | Skill → Habit |
| 2 | Learner Method | Explanation | Can explain degrees | Explanation → Skill |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why Problematic |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Self-reported without evidence | "I think I'm at Habit level" — not verifiable |
| Binary assessment | "Done / Not done" loses the 4-degree granularity |
| Never updated | Snapshot from 6 months ago does not reflect current state |
| Only tracks strong practices | Weak practices are precisely the ones needing visibility |
| Treats degrees as linear progression | Some practices may regress; checklist must capture current state honestly |

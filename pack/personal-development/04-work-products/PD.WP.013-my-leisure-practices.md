# [PD.WP.013] My Leisure Practices

---

## Definition

**My Leisure Practices** is a table of all personal leisure practices organized by time horizons (hour, day, week, month, quarter, year). Classes include: motor/sports, health maintenance, cultural-educational, passive rest, and "at least once" experiences. Updated during leisure organization practice. This is a personal inventory — not a prescription of what leisure should look like.

A leisure practices table is NOT:
- A schedule (which assigns time slots; this is an inventory of what exists)
- A wellness plan (which prescribes health interventions; this catalogs actual practices)
- A bucket list (which lists aspirations; this records what the agent actually does)
- A fitness program (which is one class of leisure practice, not the whole)

|----------|-------------|
| **Visibility** | Makes the full range of leisure practices explicit |
| **Balance check** | Reveals gaps in time horizons or practice classes |
| **Echeloned planning** | Enables planning leisure across multiple time horizons |
| **Anti-neglect** | Prevents leisure from being squeezed out by work expansion |

## Existence Criteria

| Criterion | Test |

| **At least 3 horizons** | Practices listed for at least 3 different time horizons |
| **Multiple classes** | At least 2 different practice classes represented |
| **Updated quarterly** | Last update within the past quarter |
| **Personal** | Contains the agent's actual practices, not generic recommendations |

**Existence check**: Can another person read this table and understand what specific leisure practices the agent engages in across different time horizons?

## Quality Criteria

| Criterion | Description | How to Verify |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **All horizons covered** | From hourly breaks to annual experiences | 6 horizons present |
| **All classes represented** | Motor, health, cultural, passive, "at least once" | 5 classes present |
| **Actually practiced** | Items reflect real behavior, not aspirations | Cross-check with time budget |
| **Specific enough** | "Swimming, Tue/Thu 7am" not just "sports" | Details present |
| **Quarterly review** | Updated to reflect seasonal changes and new interests | Date freshness |

### Minimal Structure

```
| Horizon | Motor/Sports | Health | Cultural | Passive | "At Least Once" |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------|---------|----------------|
| Hour | [stretch] | — | — | [tea break] | — |
| Day | [walk] | [sleep routine] | [reading] | [music] | — |
| Week | [gym ×3] | — | [museum] | [movie] | — |
| Month | [hike] | [massage] | [concert] | — | [new restaurant] |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why Problematic |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Only one class | All leisure is "Netflix" — no motor, cultural, or health practices |
| Only short horizons | Hourly/daily practices exist but no quarterly or annual — no anticipation |
| Aspirational list | Lists what agent wants to do but doesn't actually do |
| Never updated | Same list from 2 years ago despite changed interests |
| Work disguised as leisure | "Educational" practices that are actually professional tasks |

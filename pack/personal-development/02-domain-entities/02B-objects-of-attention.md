## [OA.001] Time Allocation {#oa001-time-allocation}

**What it is**: The distribution of time across activity categories over a defined period. Not abstract "time" but concrete allocation data.

**Why practitioners attend to it**: Time is a non-renewable resource. Visibility into allocation enables evidence-based decisions about time investment. Without attention to allocation, decisions are made on impressions.

**How it is observed/measured**:
- Time accounting produces quantified allocation data
- Categories must be defined for observation to be meaningful
- Granularity affects what patterns are visible

**Related methods**:
- [PD.METHOD.001 Time Accounting](../03-methods/PD.METHOD.001-time-accounting.md)

**Related work products**:
- [PD.WP.001 Time Budget](../04-work-products/PD.WP.001-time-budget.md)

**Common mistakes**:
- Attending to "time" abstractly without operationalizing as categories
- Relying on memory instead of records
- Confusing intended allocation with actual allocation

## [OA.002] Behavior Patterns {#oa002-behavior-patterns}

**What it is**: Recurring regularities in how the agent acts over time. Not single behaviors but patterns visible across instances.

**Why practitioners attend to it**: Patterns reveal habits (automatic behaviors) and trends. Single events are noise; patterns are signal. Attending to patterns enables intervention at the right level.

**How it is observed/measured**:
- Requires data across multiple periods
- Pattern recognition through comparison
- May require visualization or analysis tools

**Related methods**:
- [PD.METHOD.001 Time Accounting](../03-methods/PD.METHOD.001-time-accounting.md) (produces data for pattern detection)
- Review methods (future)

**Related work products**:
- [PD.WP.001 Time Budget](../04-work-products/PD.WP.001-time-budget.md) (source data)
- Pattern analysis artifacts (future)

**Common mistakes**:
- Seeing patterns in insufficient data
- Missing patterns due to inconsistent categories
- Treating single events as patterns

## [OA.003] Exocortex Artifacts {#oa003-exocortex-artifacts}

**What it is**: The collection of external artifacts that extend the agent's cognitive capacity — notes, records, plans, logs, tools, and their organization.

**Why practitioners attend to it**: The exocortex is the infrastructure for personal development methods. Its quality affects method performance. Artifacts are the observable outputs that evidence method execution.

**How it is observed/measured**:
- Artifact inventory (what exists)
- Artifact quality (per work product criteria)
- System coherence (do artifacts work together)

**Related methods**:
- All methods that produce artifacts

**Related work products**:
- All work products are exocortex artifacts

**Common mistakes**:
- Treating exocortex as optional ("I remember things")
- Artifact proliferation without structure
- Confusing tool possession with exocortex development

---

## [OA.004] Discrepancies (Plan vs. Actual) {#oa004-discrepancies}

**What it is**: The gap between intended allocation/behavior and actual allocation/behavior. Not the plan, not the actual, but the difference.

**Why practitioners attend to it**: Discrepancies reveal where reality diverges from intention. This information is essential for calibration (adjusting plans to reality) or intervention (adjusting reality to plans).

**How it is observed/measured**:
- Requires both plan artifact and actual artifact
- Comparison produces discrepancy data
- Magnitude and direction of discrepancy are both informative

**Related methods**:
- [PD.METHOD.001 Time Accounting](../03-methods/PD.METHOD.001-time-accounting.md) (provides actual)
- Planning methods (future, provide intended)

**Related work products**:
- [PD.WP.001 Time Budget](../04-work-products/PD.WP.001-time-budget.md) (actual side)
- Time plan (future, intended side)

**Common mistakes**:
- Having only plan (no actual to compare)
- Having only actual (no plan to compare against)
- Treating all discrepancy as failure (some is information)

## [OA.005] Resource Flows {#oa005-resource-flows}

**What it is**: The movement of resources (time, attention, energy, money) into and out of activities. Not static snapshots but flows over time.

**Why practitioners attend to it**: Resource flows reveal investment patterns. Where resources flow, capacity develops. Attending to flows enables strategic resource direction.

**How it is observed/measured**:
- Time flow: time accounting
- Attention flow: what gets reviewed, updated, used
- Energy flow: harder to measure, often proxied
- Money flow: expense tracking (adjacent domain)

**Related methods**:
- [PD.METHOD.001 Time Accounting](../03-methods/PD.METHOD.001-time-accounting.md) (time flow)

**Related work products**:
- [PD.WP.001 Time Budget](../04-work-products/PD.WP.001-time-budget.md) (time flow data)

**Common mistakes**:
- Attending only to time, ignoring attention/energy
- Static snapshots instead of flow analysis
- Confusing resource availability with resource allocation

---

## [OA.006] Method Execution Quality {#oa006-method-execution-quality}

**What it is**: How well methods are being performed — consistency, completeness, correctness. Not whether methods exist, but how they are executed.

**Why practitioners attend to it**: Method execution quality determines work product quality. Poor execution produces unreliable artifacts. Attending to execution quality enables improvement.

**How it is observed/measured**:
- Work product quality (proxy for method execution)
- Execution consistency (are methods performed regularly)
- Execution completeness (are methods performed fully)

**Related methods**:
- All methods have execution quality

**Related work products**:
- All work products reflect execution quality

**Common mistakes**:
- Assuming method knowledge = method execution
- Not reviewing work product quality
- Blaming method when execution is the issue

## What Is NOT an Object of Attention (in SPF)

| Not This | Why |
|----------|-----|
| "Life" | Too abstract; not operationalizable |
| "The domain" | Meta-level; we describe the domain, not attend to it |
| "Productivity" | Evaluative term; attend to what produces it, not it directly |
| "Happiness" | Outcome, not object of method attention |
| "Success" | Undefined without operationalization |

Objects of attention in SPF are concrete enough to be observed, measured, or produced by methods.

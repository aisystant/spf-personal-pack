## [R.001] Agent {#agent}

**Definition**: The person who is the subject of personal development. The agent performs methods on themselves and owns the resulting work products. In personal development, the agent is simultaneously the performer and the system being developed.

**Zone of responsibility**:
- Performing development methods
- Producing and maintaining personal work products
- Allocating own resources (time, attention, energy)
- Making decisions about own development direction

**Key responsibilities**:
- Execute methods (e.g., time accounting)
- Produce work products (e.g., time budget)
- Maintain artifacts (exocortex, logs, records)
- Self-observe and register data

**Methods performed**:
- [PD.METHOD.001 Time Accounting](../03-methods/PD.METHOD.001-time-accounting.md)
- (future methods)

**Work products owned**:
- [PD.WP.001 Time Budget](../04-work-products/PD.WP.001-time-budget.md)
- (future work products)

**Typical failure modes when this role is absent or poorly performed**:
- No work products created (only descriptions)
- Methods started but not sustained
- Data not recorded (relies on memory)

**Often confused with**: Person (the individual who occupies this role). See [D.002 Role vs. Person](../01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d002-role-vs-person).

## [R.002] Analyst {#analyst}

**Definition**: The role that reviews data and artifacts to identify patterns, discrepancies, and insights. In personal development, this role is often occupied by the same person as Agent, but the functions are distinct.

**Zone of responsibility**:
- Reviewing work products (time budgets, logs)
- Identifying patterns and anomalies
- Comparing actual vs. intended
- Generating insights from data

**Key responsibilities**:
- Periodic review of accumulated data
- Pattern recognition across time periods
- Discrepancy identification (plan vs. actual)
- Insight generation for decision support

**Methods performed**:
- Review methods (future)
- Analysis methods (future)

**Work products owned**:
- Review notes (future)
- Pattern reports (future)

**Typical failure modes when this role is absent or poorly performed**:
- Data accumulates without analysis
- Patterns invisible despite data availability
- Decisions made on impressions, not evidence

**Often confused with**: Agent. Agent records; Analyst interprets. Same person may occupy both, but functions differ.

---

## [R.003] Mentor {#mentor}

**Definition**: An experienced practitioner who provides guidance based on their own mastery of methods. The mentor has performed the methods themselves and can advise on application.

**Zone of responsibility**:
- Providing method-specific guidance
- Sharing experience of method application
- Reviewing agent's work products for quality
- Offering feedback on practice

**Key responsibilities**:
- Share method knowledge
- Review work products and provide feedback
- Point to common failure modes
- Model correct method performance

**Methods performed**:
- Feedback methods (future)

**Work products owned**:
- Feedback artifacts

**Typical failure modes when this role is absent or poorly performed**:
- Agent reinvents known mistakes
- Quality issues undetected
- Method drift without correction

**Often confused with**: Coach (who facilitates but may not have domain mastery), Teacher (who operates in didactic contexts — not in SPF scope).

---

## [R.004] Architect {#architect}

**Definition**: The role that designs and maintains the structure of the agent's exocortex and personal knowledge system. Decides what artifacts exist, how they relate, and what tools support them.

**Zone of responsibility**:
- Exocortex structure design
- Tool selection and configuration
- Artifact format decisions
- System coherence maintenance

**Key responsibilities**:
- Define artifact types and formats
- Select and configure tools
- Ensure artifact interoperability
- Evolve system as needs change

**Methods performed**:
- System design methods (future)

**Work products owned**:
- Exocortex architecture (future)
- Tool configuration

**Typical failure modes when this role is absent or poorly performed**:
- Artifact sprawl without structure
- Tool proliferation without integration
- Inconsistent formats preventing analysis
- System that works against the agent

**Often confused with**: Agent. Agent uses the system; Architect designs it. Same person, different function.

## Notes on Role Occupancy

In personal development, one person typically occupies all roles:
- **Agent**: When performing methods
- **Analyst**: When reviewing data
- **Mentor**: When advising peers (or absent if solo)
- **Architect**: When designing/maintaining the system

The roles remain distinct even when occupied by the same person. Conflating them leads to unclear responsibility and missing functions.

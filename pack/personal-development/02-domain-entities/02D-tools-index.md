# Tools Index: Personal Development

Tools relevant to Personal Development methods.

**Note**: Tools are secondary to methods. See [D.001 Method vs. Tool](../01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d001-method-vs-tool). This index lists tools that support methods; tool selection does not change the method.

## Tool Selection Principles

1. **Tool does not determine method**: Different tools can support the same method
2. **Avoid tool-lock**: Prefer tools with data export capabilities
3. **Match tool to context**: Paper may beat software in some contexts
4. **Beware feature creep**: More features ≠ better method support

## Common Tool Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Description | Related |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Tool = Method | Equating tool with practice | [PD.FAIL.005](../05-failure-modes/PD.FAIL.005-tool-is-method.md) |
| Tool shopping | Switching tools instead of practicing | [D.001](../01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d001-method-vs-tool) |
| Feature dependency | Method breaks when feature unavailable | — |
| Data lock-in | Cannot export/migrate data | — |

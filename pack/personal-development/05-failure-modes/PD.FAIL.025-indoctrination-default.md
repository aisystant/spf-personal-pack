# [PD.FAIL.025] Indoctrination Default / Unexamined Beliefs

---

## Definition

A worldview failure where the agent operates primarily from beliefs (memes) absorbed from their social environment — family, culture, media, authority figures — without critically examining these beliefs or replacing them with state-of-the-art transdisciplinary knowledge validated through personal experience. The agent's decisions are driven by "programs" written by others rather than by consciously chosen and tested principles.

---

## Error Type

**Type**: `worldview` — the error is in the foundational layer that determines how the agent interprets reality and makes decisions

---

## Detection Test

**How this error manifests in speech/text:**

| Symptom | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Appeal to tradition | "That's how it's always been done" |
| Appeal to authority without verification | "My guru/teacher/parent said so" |
| Inability to articulate reasoning | "I just feel this is right" — without testable basis |
| Resistance to updating beliefs | "I've already made up my mind about this" |
| Black-and-white thinking | "This is simply true/false" — without considering evidence or context |
| Meme repetition | Using popular phrases as arguments without understanding their basis |

**Test question**: Can the agent name the source of their key beliefs and describe what evidence would change them? If beliefs are treated as axioms rather than testable hypotheses — this failure mode is active.

---

## Why This Is an Error

| Aspect | Examined Worldview | Indoctrination Default |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Source of beliefs** | SoTA transdisciplines + personal experience | Social environment (family, media, culture) |
| **Belief status** | Testable hypotheses | Unquestionable axioms |
| **Decision quality** | Based on best available models | Based on potentially obsolete or false models |
| **Adaptability** | Beliefs update with new evidence | Beliefs resist change |
| **Predictive power** | High (evidence-based) | Variable (may be good or bad by luck) |

Genes determine biological body; memes (cultural information) shape personality. Without conscious effort, the agent is a product of whatever memes their environment installed — which may or may not serve their development.

---

## Root Causes

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| No habit of critical examination | Beliefs accepted passively from environment |
| Transdisciplinary ignorance | Without transdisciplines (ethics, logic, ontology), no tools to examine beliefs |
| Comfort of certainty | Unexamined beliefs provide psychological comfort; questioning them creates temporary discomfort |
| Social pressure | Examining beliefs may conflict with in-group norms |
| No writing practice | Without thinking-in-writing, beliefs remain implicit and unexamined |

---

## Risk / Harm

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Poor decision-making** | Decisions based on false or outdated models |
| **Manipulation vulnerability** | Agent can be manipulated through their unexamined beliefs |
| **Development ceiling** | Cannot grow beyond the worldview installed by environment |
| **Ethical blind spots** | May act unethically without realizing it, following culturally installed norms |
| **Conflict with evidence** | When reality contradicts beliefs, agent experiences cognitive dissonance rather than learning |

## Detection Methods

| Method | When to Apply |
|--------|---------------|
| Belief source audit | During strategizing: for each key belief, ask "where did I get this? what evidence supports it?" |
| Meme tracing | When making an important decision: trace each assumption to its source — is it personal experience, SoTA knowledge, or inherited belief? |
| Falsifiability test | For each strongly held belief: "what evidence would make me change this belief?" If nothing — it's an unexamined belief |
| Transdiscipline check | Regularly: am I studying ethics, logic, ontology — the tools needed to examine my worldview? |

# [PD.FAIL.021] Ignoring Sleep and Daily Routine

---

## Definition

Jumping to advanced self-development practices while sleep and daily routine are broken. This is the main fundamental error — without sleep and routine, other practices cannot function. The agent attempts time accounting, strategizing, SSR, and other demanding practices on a foundation of chronic sleep deprivation and chaotic daily structure.

---

## Error Type

**Type**: `methodological` — violating the prerequisite order of practice adoption

---

## Detection Test

**How this error manifests in speech/text:**

| Symptom | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Irregular sleep | "I go to bed at different times, sometimes 1 AM, sometimes 11 PM" |
| No daily routine | "Every day is different, I don't have a schedule" |
| Advanced practice attempts | "I'm trying to do time accounting" while sleeping 5 hours |
| Chronic fatigue | "I'm always tired" as a baseline condition |
| Weekend sleep debt | "I catch up on sleep on weekends" |

**Test question**: Does the agent have a stable sleep schedule (consistent bedtime and wake time, 7-8 hours) and a written daily routine? If no — this failure mode is active, and attempting other practices is building on a broken foundation.

---

## Why This Is an Error

| Practice Layer | Prerequisite | What Breaks Without It |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Sleep + Routine** | None (foundational) | Everything above |
| Time Accounting | Sleep + Routine | Cannot sustain tracking without stable schedule |
| SSR / TIW | Time Accounting + Sleep | Reading and writing quality collapse under fatigue |
| Strategizing | All above | Strategic thinking requires energy and clarity |
| Leisure Organization | Sleep + Routine | Cannot organize leisure without basic structure |

Sleep and daily routine are the foundation of all other practices. Attempting advanced practices without this foundation is like building a house starting from the second floor.

---

## Root Causes

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Underestimating sleep | "Sleep is a waste of time" or "I'll sleep when I'm dead" mentality |
| Routine seen as boring | Daily routine perceived as loss of freedom rather than enabling structure |
| Not treated as practice | Sleep and routine not recognized as practices requiring deliberate mastery |

---

## Risk / Harm

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Practice failure cascade** | Every other practice underperforms due to cognitive impairment from poor sleep |
| **False method rejection** | "Time accounting doesn't work for me" — when the actual cause is chronic fatigue |
| **Health damage** | Chronic sleep deprivation has documented medical consequences |
| **Willpower depletion** | Without routine, every decision requires willpower; the agent runs out before noon |

| Principle | [PD.PRINC.011](../01-domain-contract/01A-bounded-context.md) | Echeloned leisure principle — sleep is the base echelon |

## Detection Methods

| Method | When to Apply |
|--------|---------------|
| Sleep schedule audit | Before adopting any new practice — is sleep stable? |
| Daily routine check | Ask: show me your written daily routine. If none exists — address this first |
| Foundation-first gate | When agent wants to start advanced practices — verify sleep and routine are at "Skill" level |

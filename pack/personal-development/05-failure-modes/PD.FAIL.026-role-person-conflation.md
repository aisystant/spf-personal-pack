# [PD.FAIL.026] Role-Person Conflation in Conflict

---

## Definition

A methodological failure where the agent does not distinguish between role interests and personal dissatisfactions, leading to situations where criticism of role performance is perceived as personal attack, and negotiation of role interests escalates into interpersonal conflict. The agent identifies with their role so completely that they cannot separate "this role is not well-played" from "I am bad."

---

## Error Type

**Type**: `methodological` — failure to apply the distinction between agent and role in practical situations

---

## Detection Test

**How this error manifests in speech/text:**

| Symptom | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Taking feedback personally | "She doesn't respect me" (when feedback was about work product quality) |
| Emotional escalation in work discussions | A disagreement about method becomes personal antagonism |
| Identity statements about roles | "I AM a programmer" instead of "I play the role of programmer" |
| Unable to change roles | "If I stop being a manager, who am I?" |
| Defending poor work as self-defense | "You're attacking me!" when someone critiques a deliverable |
| Personal grudges from role conflicts | "He opposed my proposal, so he's my enemy" |

**Test question**: When someone critiques the agent's work, does the agent feel personally threatened? If yes — role-person conflation is present.

---

## Why This Is an Error

| Aspect | Role-Person Separated | Role-Person Conflated |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Feedback reception** | "My work product needs improvement" | "I am being attacked" |
| **Conflict nature** | Role interests can be negotiated | Personal conflict with no resolution protocol |
| **Role switching** | Easy — "I can play different roles" | Painful — "changing roles = losing identity" |
| **Growth** | Can improve role performance without ego threat | Improvement implies "I was bad before" |
| **Collaboration** | Can oppose someone's proposal and remain friendly | Opposition = enmity |

The distinction between agent and role is fundamental: one agent can play many roles; one role can be played by different agents. Role interests and preferences belong to the role, not to the person. Dissatisfactions and intentions belong to the agent.

## Root Causes

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| No agent-role distinction | Never learned that "role" and "person" are separate concepts |
| Cultural norms | Many cultures treat professional identity as personal identity |
| Low role mastery | When the agent has only one role, it becomes their entire identity |
| Emotional unawareness | Cannot distinguish role-based frustration from personal hurt |

---

## Risk / Harm

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Toxic conflicts** | Work disagreements become personal feuds |
| **Feedback avoidance** | Agent avoids or rejects feedback to protect ego |
| **Career rigidity** | Cannot change roles or professions because identity is fused with current role |
| **Team dysfunction** | Teams where members conflate role and person cannot have honest discussions about quality |
| **Burnout** | Every work challenge feels like a personal challenge, depleting emotional resources |

## Detection Methods

| Method | When to Apply |
|--------|---------------|
| Role audit | During strategizing: list all roles currently played — can the agent name them separately from "who I am"? |
| Feedback reaction check | After receiving criticism: was the emotional response proportional to the role issue or inflated by personal identification? |
| Conflation language scan | In written reflections: does the agent use "I am X" or "I play the role of X"? |
| Role switching exercise | Can the agent imagine someone else playing their current role? If this feels threatening — conflation is present |

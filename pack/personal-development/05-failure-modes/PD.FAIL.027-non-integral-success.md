# [PD.FAIL.027] Non-Integral Success / Success in One Sphere at Cost of Others

---

## Definition

A structural failure where the agent achieves outstanding results in one sphere of life (career, business, science) while having critical failures in other spheres (health, family, relationships, self-development). This contradicts the principle of integral success: the ability to create one of the best systems in at least one sphere while maintaining satisfactory results in all others. Many "successful people" pay too high a price — their success is sufficient for public relations but not for a fulfilling life.

## Error Type

**Type**: `structural` — a persistent life-architecture pattern, not a momentary mistake

---

## Detection Test

**How this error manifests in speech/text:**

| Symptom | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Justifying neglect | "I don't have time for family — I'm building a company" |
| Health sacrifice | "Sleep is for the weak; I'll rest when I'm dead" |
| Single-metric optimization | Measuring life success solely by revenue, followers, or titles |
| Relationship debt | Estranged children, broken marriages, no close friends |
| Public image vs. reality gap | Publicly successful, privately struggling |
| "I'll fix it later" | "Once I achieve X, I'll focus on health/family/friends" |

**Test question**: Can the agent honestly rate their satisfaction across all major life spheres (family, health, career, finances, relationships, education, community)? If more than one sphere is rated critically low while one is exceptionally high — this failure mode is present.

## Why This Is an Error

| Aspect | Integral Success | Non-Integral Success |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Life spheres** | Excellent in 1+, satisfactory in all | Excellent in 1, failing in several |
| **Sustainability** | Sustainable — no sphere creating cascading problems | Fragile — failed spheres undermine the successful one |
| **Role model value** | Can be emulated holistically | "Don't emulate their life, just their method" |
| **Happiness** | Possible — no persistent suffering from failed spheres | Unlikely — success in one sphere cannot compensate for suffering in others |
| **Price** | Time investment distributed across spheres | Entire time budget consumed by one sphere |

As the source states: "The concept of a successful person should be integral — whole, complete." An engineer who created great technology but has no relationship with his children is not integrally successful.

## Root Causes

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Narrow definition of success | Culture equates success with career achievement or wealth |
| Time management failure | All hours invested in one area; no echeloned defense |
| Role identity fusion | Agent identifies with one role (entrepreneur, scientist) to the exclusion of others |
| Delayed gratification fallacy | "I'll fix other areas after I succeed here" — but that day never comes |
| No strategizing practice | Without regular life-wide strategizing, imbalances go unnoticed |

---

## Risk / Harm

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Cascading failure** | Health problems undermine career; broken family creates emotional instability |
| **Hollow achievement** | External recognition without internal fulfillment |
| **Poor role model** | Others emulate the visible success without seeing the hidden cost |
| **Irreversibility** | Some failures cannot be reversed — missed children's childhood, destroyed health |
| **Late realization** | Agent realizes the imbalance too late, when correction is difficult or impossible |

## Detection Methods

| Method | When to Apply |
|--------|---------------|
| Life sphere audit | During strategizing: rate each sphere 1-10 — are there critical gaps? |
| Time allocation review | Weekly: how is time distributed across spheres? Is any sphere getting zero investment? |
| Role inventory | Quarterly: list all life roles — which are actively played, which are neglected? |
| Integral success check | Annually: would someone want to trade lives with me completely (not just career/money)? |

# [PD.FAIL.014] Perfectionism Paralysis

---

## Definition

Applying publication-quality standards to what should be a draft. The beginner unconsciously expects public article quality from stage-4 output (draft), which is a pipeline intermediate — not a final product. This creates paralysis: the agent cannot share drafts because they never meet the (wrong) standard.

---

## Error Type

**Type**: `methodological` — applying the wrong quality standard to a pipeline stage

---

## Detection Test

**How this error manifests in speech/text:**

| Symptom | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Cannot share drafts | "It's not ready to show anyone" |
| Endless rewriting | "I've rewritten this introduction 7 times" |
| Comparison with publications | "It doesn't look like [famous author]'s articles" |
| Delaying publication | "I'll publish when it's perfect" |
| Self-deprecation | "My writing isn't good enough" |

**Test question**: Is the agent unable to share drafts? The correct criterion is not "Is this publication-quality?" but "Is today's draft better than yesterday's?"

---

## Why This Is an Error

| Aspect | Draft (Stage 4) | Publication (Stage 5) |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Purpose** | Capture and organize thinking | Communicate to audience |
| **Audience** | Self, close collaborators | Public |
| **Quality standard** | Better than previous draft | Meets editorial standard |
| **Iteration** | Expected and normal | Minimal, polished |
| **Sharing criterion** | "Does it capture the idea?" | "Is it clear and complete?" |

Confusing draft and publication means the agent can never release work. Every draft is judged by the wrong standard and found wanting. The pipeline stalls at stage 4 indefinitely.

---

## Root Causes

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Distinction confusion | Confusing Draft and Publication (D.026) — treating pipeline stages as one |
| No pipeline understanding | Not knowing that creative output goes through stages with different standards |
| External validation focus | Seeking approval rather than using writing as a thinking tool |

---

## Risk / Harm

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Pipeline stall** | Nothing ever reaches publication because drafts are never "good enough" |
| **Writing aversion** | Negative association with writing from repeated perceived failure |
| **Growth block** | Publishing forces thinking clarification; without it, thinking remains vague |
| **Feedback deprivation** | Unpublished work receives no external feedback to improve |

## Detection Methods

| Method | When to Apply |
|--------|---------------|
| Draft sharing test | Ask: when did you last share a draft with someone? |
| Quality standard audit | Ask: what standard are you applying to this draft? |
| Pipeline flow check | Count: how many drafts in the past month reached publication? |

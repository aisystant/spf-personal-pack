# [PD.FAIL.030] Excessive Composure / Hyper-Focus

---

## Definition

A methodological failure where the agent over-applies composure practices: micromanaging every minute, experiencing paralysis from excessive stop-moments, and treating any deviation from the plan as a failure. The agent becomes rigid rather than focused, controlling rather than composed. This is the opposite extreme of the discomposure cycle (FAIL.029) — where discomposure is too little structure, excessive composure is too much.

---

## Error Type

**Type**: `methodological` — misapplication of composure practices by taking them to a harmful extreme

---

## Detection Test

**How this error manifests in speech/text:**

| Symptom | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Micromanaging time | "I track every single minute and feel anxious if I can't account for 15 minutes" |
| Plan rigidity | "My plan said X, but Y happened — the whole day is ruined" |
| Inability to relax | "I can't enjoy leisure because I keep thinking I should be doing something productive" |
| Perfectionism about tracking | "My time accounting has to be perfect — no gaps, no approximations" |
| Social isolation | "I can't meet friends spontaneously — it's not in my plan" |
| Over-frequent stop-moments | Pausing so often that flow states become impossible |

**Test question**: Does the agent experience guilt or anxiety when deviating from their plan, even for legitimate reasons? Does the agent find it difficult to engage in unplanned leisure or social activities? If yes — excessive composure is likely present.

## Why This Is an Error

| Aspect | Balanced Composure | Excessive Composure |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Relationship to plan** | Plan as tool — adjusted when reality changes | Plan as law — any deviation is failure |
| **Stop-moments** | Applied at natural transition points | Applied so frequently that work is fragmented |
| **Leisure** | Echeloned, deliberate, enjoyable | Scheduled to the minute, feels like another task |
| **Flexibility** | Can respond to opportunities and surprises | Rigid — unexpected events cause stress |
| **Social life** | Integrated into time budget naturally | Squeezed out or over-regulated |
| **Internal state** | Calm, focused, present | Tense, controlling, anxious about deviations |

Composure is a means of maintaining attention and directing effort, not an end in itself. When the practice of composure generates more stress than it relieves, it has been over-applied. The principle of echeloned leisure (PRINC.011) requires balance — periods of high focus alternating with genuine rest.

## Root Causes

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Perfectionism transferred to method | Agent applies perfectionist tendencies to the composure practice itself |
| Control as anxiety management | Agent uses hyper-control to manage underlying anxiety — the structure provides false security |
| Misunderstanding of composure | Composure confused with total control; flexibility seen as weakness |
| No echeloned leisure practice | PRINC.011 not understood — agent does not build deliberate rest into their structure |
| Identity fusion with productivity | Agent's self-worth tied to "being productive every minute" |

---

## Risk / Harm

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Burnout through rigidity** | No genuine recovery — even "rest" is scheduled and monitored |
| **Social isolation** | Friends and family stop inviting the agent to spontaneous activities |
| **Flow state destruction** | Over-frequent stop-moments prevent deep work |
| **Fragile system** | Any disruption (illness, emergency, travel) causes disproportionate stress |
| **Method rejection** | Agent eventually burns out and abandons all structure — swinging to the opposite extreme (FAIL.029) |

## Detection Methods

| Method | When to Apply |
|--------|---------------|
| Flexibility test | Can the agent accept a spontaneous invitation without significant anxiety? If not — investigate |
| Deviation response check | When plans change unexpectedly — does the agent adapt or experience distress? |
| Leisure quality audit | During weekly review: was leisure genuinely restorative, or did it feel like another scheduled obligation? |
| Social connection check | Monthly: has the agent engaged in unplanned social interactions? If zero — excessive composure may be isolating them |

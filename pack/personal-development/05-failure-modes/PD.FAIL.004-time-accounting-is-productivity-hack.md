## Definition

This failure mode occurs when time accounting is framed as a "life hack" or quick productivity fix. The agent expects immediate efficiency gains from starting to account, treating it as an optimization technique rather than an information method.

---

## Error Type

**Type**: `deprecated-interpretation` — applying a pop-productivity frame to an epistemological method

---

## Detection Test

**How this error manifests in speech/text:**

| Symptom | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Hack framing | "Time accounting is my new productivity hack" |
| Quick-win expectation | "This will boost my productivity right away" |
| Efficiency focus | "I'll be so much more efficient once I track" |
| Before/after thinking | "Watch my productivity skyrocket" |
| Tool-centricity | "This app will make me productive" |

**Test question**: Does the agent expect accounting itself to produce efficiency, or to produce data that informs efficiency decisions?

---

## Why This Is an Error

| Aspect | Productivity Hack | Time Accounting |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Timeframe** | Immediate results | Cumulative data over time |
| **Mechanism** | Trick or shortcut | Systematic registration |
| **Promise** | Do less, get more | Know more, decide better |
| **Depth** | Surface behavior change | Information foundation |

Accounting is infrastructure for decision-making, not a lever for immediate output increase. The "hack" framing sets false expectations and leads to abandonment when quick gains don't materialize.

---

## Correct Distinction

**Reference**: [D.010 Infrastructure vs. Intervention](../01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d010-infrastructure-vs-intervention)

Infrastructure methods (accounting) build capacity for future decisions. Intervention methods act directly on outcomes. Confusing them leads to expecting infrastructure to produce intervention-level results immediately.

---

## Risk / Harm

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Premature abandonment** | "Didn't work" after one week — wrong success criterion |
| **Method shopping** | Jumping to next "hack" instead of building information base |
| **Shallow engagement** | Not committing to consistency required for pattern visibility |
| **Misattribution of value** | "Accounting is useless" when actual issue is wrong expectation |

## Detection Methods

| Method | When to Apply |
|--------|---------------|
| Framing analysis | Does agent use "hack", "trick", "boost" language? |
| Timeline expectation | What results does agent expect in first week? |
| Commitment level | Is agent prepared for months of consistent registration? |
